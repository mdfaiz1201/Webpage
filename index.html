                  What is Blockchain?
                </h2>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of
                  records (blocks) that are securely linked together via
                  cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash
                  of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
                  (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
                  represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the
                  transaction data existed when the block was created. Since
                  each block contains information about the previous block, they
                  effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure),
                  with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
                  Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in
                  that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
                  cannot be altered retroactively without altering all
                  subsequent blocks.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
                  computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where
                  nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to
                  add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain
                  records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are
                  possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and
                  exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
                  fault tolerance.

                <p>
                  A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people)
                  using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to
                  serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin
                  cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart
                  Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The
                  implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the
                  first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem
                  without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The
                  bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and
                  blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely
                  used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a
                  type of payment rail.

                  Private blockchains have been proposed for business use.
                  Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized
                  blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil"
                  however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if
                  carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore
                  more secure in practice than permissionless ones.

                <hr />
                <p>
                  Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain
                  networks â€” public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium
                  blockchains and hybrid blockchains.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Public blockchain</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions.
                  Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it
                  as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the
                  execution of a consensus protocol).[self-published source?]
                  Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who
                  secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof
                  of Work algorithm.<br />
                  Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the
                  bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Private blockchains</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A private blockchain is permissioned. One cannot join it
                  unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and
                  validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open
                  blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database
                  applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the
                  terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for
                  private blockchains.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hybrid blockchains</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and
                  decentralized features. The exact workings of the chain can
                  vary based on which portions of centralization and
                  decentralization are used.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Sidechains</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs
                  in parallel to a primary blockchain. Entries from the primary
                  blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital
                  assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows
                  the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the
                  primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of
                  record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[better

              <p>
                A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public,
                digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used
                to record transactions across many computers so that any
                involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the
                alteration of all subsequent blocks.This allows the participants
                to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively
                inexpensively. A blockchain database is managed autonomously
                using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping
                server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by
                collective self-interests. Such a design facilitates robust
                workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security
                is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic
                of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms
                that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the
                long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been
                described as a value-exchange protocol. A blockchain can
                maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail
                the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer
                and acceptance.[citation needed]<br />Logically, a blockchain
                can be seen as consisting of several layers:

                Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured from proof of concept by late 2016. As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back office.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp has estimated that corporate investment into blockchain technology will reach $12.4 billion by 2022. Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicates a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.

                In 2019 the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy identified blockchain as a technology that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society. The economist and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford discussed why the underlying technology might have much wider applications and the challenges that needed to be overcome. First broadcast 29 June 2019.

              Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups." Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block. Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.
